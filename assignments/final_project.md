# Final project

Projects consist of a manuscript and a tutorial that describes all the steps of the analysis in a reproducible manner. 

## Learning objectives  
1. Be able to identify a statistical model that is appropriate for answering a given research question.  
2. Be able to evaluate said statistical model and reflect on strengths and weaknesses. 
3. Be able to interpret and communicate the results.
