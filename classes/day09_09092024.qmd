## Estimation, uncertainty estimation - a summary  

- Why do we need statistics?   
- What is a statistical model?  
- Research/curious question, statistical model, R program.  
- Advice: start simple and add complexity gradually.  

Let's take the traditional general linear model,  

$$\mathbf{y} \sim N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \sigma^2\mathbf{I}),$$

$$\boldsymbol\mu = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta,$$
where $\mathbf{y}$ is a vector containing the observed data, $\boldsymbol\mu$ is a vector of the means of those observations, $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the data and $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix, that is a diagonal of 1s and the rest are zeroes.  

This is the same as writing 

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}, $$

$$\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \overset{\mathrm{iid}}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2 \mathbf{I})$$

A few big assumptions we are making:  

- Normal distribution of the data (of the residuals).    
- iid residuals  
- homoscedasticity  
- linearity  

Recall some of the properties of the estimator $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$:   

- unbiased  
- 'best linear unbiased estimator' (BLUE), minimum variance.  

That is the same as running the following `lm` function in R:  

```{r eval = FALSE}
lm(response ~ 1 + x1 + x2, data = data)
```

#### Uncertainty  

There is uncertainty associated to all estimates because (i) models are only a simplification of reality, and (ii) we observe a limited amount of data.  
For example, we have 
$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sim N(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \frac{\sigma^2}{(n-1)s^2_x}),$$
 
$$y_{new} \sim N(\mu_{new}, \sigma^2),$$
and  

$$\hat{y}_{new} \sim N(\hat{\mu}_{new}, \hat{\sigma}^2).$$

That is why, when reporting a point estimate (of $\beta$, $y$ or $y_{new}$), there is some unceratinty associated. For example, for any estimate $\hat\theta$, we know that the 95%CI is 
$$ \hat{\theta} \pm t_{dfe, 1 - \alpha/2} \ s.e._{\theta}.$$

- For $\hat\beta$, $s.e.(\hat\beta) = \frac{\hat\sigma}{s_x\sqrt{n-1}}$.

- For $E(y_{new}|x_{new})$, $s.e.(\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}x_{new}) = \hat{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}+ \frac{(x-\hat\mu_x)^2}{(n-1)s_x^2}}$.

- For $y_{new}|x_{new}$, $s.e.(y_{new})=\hat\sigma \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}+ \frac{(x-\hat\mu_x)^2}{(n-1)s_x^2}}$. 

- Let's analyze these.  

### What is coming next and the connection with uncertainty  

- Mean comparison  
- The connection between 95%CI and an hypothesis test with $\alpha = 0.05$  

### What is coming after that   

- A temptative roadmap  

### Announcements 

- Office hours today are 2-3pm.
