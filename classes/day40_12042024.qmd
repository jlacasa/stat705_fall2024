## This is it! Final wrap-up of STAT 750   


#### What is a statistical model  

- An abstraction, a summary.  
- Deterministic equation + likelihood function  
  (mathematical formula of the (linear) predictor + probability distribution)   
- Steps to design a statistical model:  
  - Define the distribution the data arise from.  
  - Define the linear predictor. 
  - Select a method to estimate the parameters. 
    - Least Squares
    - Maximum Likelihood Estimation  
    - REML  
    - Bayesian Estimation (check of STAT 786 - Applied Bayesian Modeling and Prediction)

#### Key things to report  

- Expected value.  
- Uncertainty!!!  

#### Statistics as a catalyzer of scientific progress  

- The connection between scientific questions and statistics.
